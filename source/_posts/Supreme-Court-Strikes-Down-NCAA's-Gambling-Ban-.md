#  Supreme Court Strikes Down NCAA's Gambling Ban 

The United States Supreme Court today struck down a federal law that bans gambling on college sports, ruling that the law unfairly prohibits states from allowing some forms of sports betting. The decision is a major victory for New Jersey, which has been struggling for years to allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting.

The court's 6-3 decision in Murphy v. NCAA overturned a 1992 law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which had prevented New Jersey and other states from permitting any form of sports betting. The law was challenged by New Jersey after state voters approved a measure in 2011 to allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks.

Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that PASPA violated the anti-commandeering doctrine, which holds that the federal government cannot compel states to carry out its laws. "The provision unequivocally dictates what state governments may and may not do," Alito wrote. "It is not passed pursuant to Congress' Article I power to regulate interstate commerce."

Justice Anthony Kennedy, who joined with the majority, said that the anti-commandeering doctrine is "critically important" in preserving the sovereignty of states. "Congress may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States' officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program," Kennedy wrote.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Ginsburg argued that PASPA did not violate the anti-commandeering doctrine because it allowed states to decline to allow gambling on college sports. "All PASPA does is prohibit one form of gambling — state-authorized professional and collegiate sports wagering — while leaving other types of gambling entirely untouched," Ginsburg wrote.

Justice Clarence Thomas did not participate in the case.

#  Murphy v. NCAA Opens Door for Other Sports Leagues To Run Gambling Operations 

The year was 2018, and the Supreme Court of the United States had just ruled in favor of New Jersey in the case of Murphy v. NCAA. This landmark ruling opened the door for other professional sports leagues to operate their own legalized gambling operations. At the time, many experts felt that this ruling would be a major boon for the NFL, given that casino gaming is incredibly popular in Nevada, home to America’s most popular professional sports league.

Fast-forward a few years, and it’s clear that other leagues have taken advantage of the ruling in Murphy v. NCAA. The NBA has partnered with MGM Resorts International to launch a branded online casino, while the NHL has teamed up with The Stars Group (parent company of PokerStars) to create an online sportsbook. Even Major League Baseball has gotten into the game, partnering with DraftKings to create an extensive suite of betting options for its fans.

All told, it’s estimated that American consumers will wager more than $8 billion on sports betting this year, up from $4.7 billion in 2018. With so much money flowing through the system, it’s no surprise that professional sports leagues are looking to get a piece of the action. And while there are some concerns about how widespread gambling could ultimately become, it’s clear that the major sports leagues have embraced legalized gambling as a major source of revenue growth.

#  Supreme Court Ruling Could Spur New Gambling Ventures by Professional Sports Leagues 

The United States Supreme Court on Monday overturned a federal law that banned states from legalizing sports betting, opening the door for professional sports leagues to enter the gambling market.

The decision could pave the way for the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and National Hockey League (NHL) to launch their own sportsbooks and gaming ventures.

“We are analyzing the Supreme Court’s decision to determine its impact on our business and look forward to continuing to serve our fans and partners,” said NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy in a statement.

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been a vocal proponent of legalized sports betting and said shortly after the ruling that the league is looking into launching its own gaming venture.

“Today’s ruling will have profound effects on our business and we are beginning to explore those options immediately,” Silver said in a statement.

MLB issued a similar statement, saying it is “reviewing all implications of the Supreme Court’s decision.” The NHL also announced that it is evaluating its options in regards to sports betting.

The Professional Golfers Association (PGA) has already moved ahead with plans to offer sports betting on its tournaments, partnering with MGM Resorts International last year.

Westgate SuperBookRace & Sportsbook manager Jeff Sherman told ESPN that he expects all major professional sports leagues to eventually offer some form of legal gambling on their games.

"I think within five years, every state in the country will have some legalized form of sports betting," Sherman said.

#  Sports Leagues Poised to Cash In on Legalized Gambling with Murphy v. NCAA Ruling 


The legality of sports gambling is a hot topic in the United States, and on Monday, May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court made a landmark ruling in favor of legalizing it. In Murphy v. NCAA, the court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was unconstitutional. PASPA was a law passed in 1992 that effectively banned sports gambling nationwide.

The reaction to the ruling was largely positive among those in the sports gambling industry. John Asher, vice president of communications for Churchill Downs Inc., said that his company is “pleased with today’s Supreme Court decision” and that they are “looking forward to bringing wagering on horse racing back to our states.”

Jay Monahan, commissioner of the PGA Tour, also issued a statement in support of the ruling. He said that the tour is “committed to maintaining the integrity of our sport and looks forward to partnering with like-minded governments and gaming operators around the world to promote responsible gaming and protect the interests of fans everywhere.”

It’s clear that many in the sports world see this as an opportunity to cash in on legalized gambling. And there is good reason for them to be optimistic. A study commissioned by the American Gaming Association found that if sports gambling were legalized nationwide, it would generate $6.2 billion in annual revenue. That number is likely conservative, as it doesn’t take into account potential growth in the industry.

It will be interesting to see how individual states approach legalized gambling. There are many who will want to jump on board and cash in on this new revenue stream, but there will also be those who are more hesitant due to concerns about addiction and other negative consequences of gambling.

Whatever approach individual states take, it is clear that Monday’s ruling will have a major impact on sports leagues across the country. They stand to make billions of dollars from legalized gambling, and you can bet they will be looking to get their share.

#  With Murphy v. NCAA, Supreme Court Paves Way for Broad Expansion of Sports Betting

Today, in a landmark 6-3 decision, the United States Supreme Court struck down a 1992 law that had effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide. The case, Murphy v. NCAA, was brought by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and other state officials in an effort to bring more tax revenue to their state.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the federal law "infringes the sovereignty of the States and violates the Tenth Amendment." He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.

Justice Elena Kagan wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Sonia Sotomayor. She argued that the law is a reasonable measure to protect the integrity of sporting events.

The repeal of the federal ban clears the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders. Several states have already signaled their intention to do so.
