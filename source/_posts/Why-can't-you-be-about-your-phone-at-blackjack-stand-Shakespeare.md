#  Why can't you be about your phone at blackjack stand Shakespeare?

For a casino dealer, there's nothing more frustrating than seeing someone at the blackjack table with their face buried in their phone. It's not that they're not enjoying the game; it's that they're not paying attention! The dealer is trying to make a living, and if players are busy on their phones instead of playing the game, it makes things more difficult.

There are a few obvious reasons why you should put your phone away while you're playing blackjack. First of all, it's just rude. When you're at a table with other players, you should be paying attention to them and the game, not your phone. Secondly, it can actually cost you money. If you're busy on your phone and miss something important at the table, like the dealer announcing that it's time to hit or stay, you could wind up making a poor decision that costs you money.

Finally, phones can be a distraction and make it difficult to focus on the game. If you're constantly checking your phone for messages or notifications, you're not going to be able to pay close attention to what's happening at the table. This can lead to mistakes and missed opportunities.

So if you want to make the dealer's life easier (and save yourself some money) put your phone away and enjoy the game!

#  Why can't you focus at the table?

Your parents always told you to focus at the table, but now as an adult, you find it difficult to do so. Why is that? According to a recent study, adults are actually worse at focusing when they’re sitting at a table than when they’re standing.

The study, which was conducted by the University of Sydney, found that when adults are seated at a table, their cognitive abilities decline by as much as 10 percent. However, when they’re standing, their cognitive abilities decline by just five percent.

So why is this the case? One possible explanation is that when we’re seated at a table, we tend to be less active and more sedentary. This can lead to a decline in our cognitive abilities. Additionally, when we’re seated at a table, we tend to be more distracted by our surroundings and the tasks we’re performing.

However, there are also benefits to being seated at a table. For example, when we’re seated at a table, we can more easily communicate with others. Additionally, we can use our hands and arms to perform tasks and interact with our environment.

So what should you do? If you need to focus on a task, try standing up instead of sitting down. If you need to communicate with someone, try sitting down at a table instead of standing up.

#  How rude!

Chances are, if you've spent any time in the United States, you've heard the expression "how rude!" thrown around quite a bit. But where did this phrase come from, and what does it mean?

The exact origin of the phrase is unknown, but it's thought to date back to the early 1900s. Originally, "how rude!" was used as a way of indicating that someone had done something impolite or socially unacceptable. For example, if you saw someone picking their nose in public, you might say "how rude!" to indicate that you thought their behavior was gross and uncalled for.

These days, the phrase is used more generally to express disapproval or frustration. For example, if your friend cuts in line at the coffee shop, you might say "how rude!" to express your annoyance. Or if your boss asks you to work overtime on a weekend, you might say "how rude!" to show that you're not happy about it.

So next time you're annoyed with someone's behavior, remember to say "how rude!" It's a surefire way to let them know that they've crossed the line.

#  Guess you're not interested in winning

How many times have you seen this on a betting slip?
Did you know that it's actually impossible to win using this type of bet?

The odds of guessing correctly are 1 in 10, or 10%, so for every £10 staked, the punter can expect to recoup just £1.  So even if there was an event with only two possible outcomes (such as a coin toss), the bookmaker would still be making a healthy profit on each and every transaction.

And yet people keep betting on "Guess the Result" games, despite the fact that they can never win. Why is that?

One explanation could be that people are simply not aware of the true odds. They may think that because there's only one correct answer, their chances of winning must be better than 10%.  But even if they do know about the low chances of success, some folks may still bet on "Guess the Result" games because they believe that luck will be on their side – after all, it could always be their turn to beat the odds, right?

There may also be a psychological element at play here. For some people, the thrill of betting outweighs any concerns about whether or not they're likely to win. Also, making a small loss is preferable to not betting at all, which is another reason why these types of wagers remain popular.

Whatever the reason may be, if you're hoping to make some money from betting, avoiding "Guess the Result" games is definitely advisable. There are much better ways to play the odds and give yourself a chance to come out ahead.

#  Put your phone away and start paying attention!

We've all been there before, sitting in a meeting or class, and our phone is just sitting there tempting us. We try to resist, but eventually we give in and check our notifications. Before we know it, half an hour has gone by and we've missed out on what was happening in the meeting. This is just one example of how technology can take away from our attention.

It's not just phones that can be a distraction, though. TVs, computers, and even books can keep us from paying attention to what's going on around us. For example, if you're reading a book and someone talks to you, are you really listening to them or are you still lost in the story? Technology can be a great thing, but it's important to remember that it shouldn't take away from our attention.

Luckily, there are ways to help improve our attention span. One way is to set boundaries for ourselves. For example, make sure that we only check our phone once an hour or only use it for certain tasks. Another way is to be more mindful of what we're doing and how we're using technology. For example, try not to multi-task and instead focus on one task at a time.

Finally, it's important to remember that not everyone is the same. What might work for someone else might not work for us. So it's important to experiment with different strategies until we find something that works best for us.
