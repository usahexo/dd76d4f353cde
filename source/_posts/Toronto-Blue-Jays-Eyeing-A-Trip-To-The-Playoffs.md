#  Toronto Blue Jays Eyeing A Trip To The Playoffs

Toronto Blue Jays Eyeing A Trip To The Playoffs
. For the Toronto Blue Jays, the 2017 season has been all about bouncing back from a disappointing 2016 campaign. After starting the season with a disappointing 16-24 record, the Blue Jays have turned things around, and are now in the hunt for a trip to the playoffs. The Blue Jays are currently in second place in the American League East with a record of 73-59, just three games behind the first-place Boston Red Sox.

One of the main reasons for the Blue Jays resurgence this season has been the play of their All-Star slugger, Jose Bautista. Bautista is having another solid season at the plate, hitting .261 with 28 home runs and 85 RBIs. Another big contributor for Toronto this season has been outfielder Kevin Pillar, who is hitting .285 with 12 home runs and 53 RBIs.

The Blue Jays pitching staff has also been solid this season, led by starting pitcher Aaron Sanchez. Sanchez is 15-2 with a 3.00 ERA this season, and is one of the front runners for American League Cy Young Award. Other key contributors in Toronto's bullpen include Roberto Osuna and Jason Grilli.

If the Blue Jays want to make a run at the playoffs this season, they will need to continue playing solid baseball down the stretch. One thing that could help them down the stretch is if they can get some contributions from their younger players. Players like second baseman Devon Travis and outfielder Teoscar Hernandez have shown promise this season, but will need to continue to produce if Toronto wants to make a playoff run.

The Toronto Blue Jays appear to be headed back to the playoffs in 2017. With their talented roster and strong pitching staff, they have what it takes to make a deep run in this year's postseason tournament

#  Toronto Blue Jays: “We’re In It To Win It”

The Toronto Blue Jays kicked off their season a few weeks ago and they are looking to make a statement this year. The Blue Jays were in the playoffs last year but they were knocked out by the Texas Rangers. This year, the Blue Jays are saying that they are “in it to win it”.

The Blue Jays have a very strong lineup this year. They have José Bautista, who is one of the best hitters in baseball. They also have Josh Donaldson, who is also one of the best hitters in baseball. The Blue Jays also have Edwin Encarnación, who is one of the best hitters in all of baseball.

The Blue Jays also have some great starting pitchers this year. Marcus Stroman is one of the top young pitchers in baseball. He had a great season last year and he is looking to continue that this year. The Blue Jays also have Aaron Sanchez, who is another great young pitcher. He had a great season last year and he is looking to continue that this year. The Blue Jays also have J.A. Happ, who is a veteran pitcher and he is looking to have a good season this year.

The Blue Jays are definitely looking like a team that can go all the way this year. They have a very strong lineup and they also have some great starting pitchers. The only thing that can stop them is themselves. If they can play as a team and stay focused, then they definitely have a chance to win it all this year!

#  The Blueprint: How The Toronto Blue Jays Can Make The Playoffs

The Toronto Blue Jays are in a precarious position. Heading into the all-star break, they sit just two games back of first place in the American League East but only half a game up on the Baltimore Orioles for the second wild card spot. The Blue Jays have been inconsistent all season long and they'll need to play much better down the stretch to make the playoffs.

Luckily for them, they have a blueprint of how to do just that. Here's a look at how the Blue Jays can make the playoffs:

1) The starting rotation needs to be better

It's no secret that the starting rotation has been a huge weak spot for the Blue Jays this season. They've been relying too much on their offence to carry them and it's come back to bite them at times. The starters need to pitch deeper into games and give the team a chance to win. Aaron Sanchez has been the best starter for Toronto this season, but he'll need help from Marco Estrada, J.A. Happ, and Marcus Stroman down the stretch.

2) The bullpen needs to be more reliable

The bullpen has also been a big issue for the Blue Jays this season. They've blown far too many save opportunities and it's cost them dearly. Roberto Osuna has been good as usual, but he needs some help from Jason Grilli, Joe Biagini, and others down the stretch. If they can get more reliable performances from their bullpen, it will go a long way in securing playoff berth.

3) Edwin Encarnacion needs to stay hot

Edwin Encarnacion has been one of the best hitters in baseball this season and he'll be key in getting Toronto into the playoffs. He's already hit 30 home runs and 100 RBIs and he's poised for a strong finish down the stretch. If he can continue to hit like he has all season long, it will give Toronto an edge over their opponents.

4) The defence needs to play better

The Blue Jays defence hasn't been as good as it was last season and that's hurt them at times. They need Troy Tulowitzki, Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, and Kevin Pillar to play at their best defensively if they want to make the playoffs. If they can tighten things up in the outfield and infield, it will go a long way in improving their chances of making noise in October.

#  5 Reasons Why You Shouldn’t Sleep On The Toronto Blue Jays In 2017

Toronto Blue Jays

It seems as though the Toronto Blue Jays are always one of those teams that fly a bit under the radar. After reaching the American League Championship Series in two consecutive seasons, expectations were high for the Blue Jays in 2016. However, they failed to make the playoffs, resulting in the firing of manager John Gibbons and general manager Alex Anthopoulos.

Entering 2017, many people have forgotten about Toronto and written them off as contenders. I’m here to tell you that you should not sleep on the Blue Jays this season. Here are five reasons why:

1) The offense is still potent

Despite losing Edwin Encarnacion in free agency, the Blue Jays still have a potent lineup. Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Troy Tulowitzki are all All-Stars and can put up big numbers. The addition of Kendrys Morales should also help fill the void left by Encarnacion.

2) The starting rotation is underrated

The starting rotation was a big question mark for the Blue Jays heading into 2017. However, they’ve actually been pretty good so far this season. Aaron Sanchez has emerged as an ace pitcher, while Marco Estrada and J.A. Happ have also been solid. If the rotation can keep up this level of play, it will be a big boost for the team.

3) The bullpen is nasty

One of the main reasons why the Blue Jays failed to make the playoffs last year was their shoddy bullpen performance. This season, however, things have been different thanks to the addition of Roberto Osuna and Joe Smith. The bullpen is now one of Toronto’s biggest strengths.

4) They’re playing well right now

The Blue Jays currently have a winning record and are in first place in their division. Heading into the second half of the season, they appear to be peaking at just the right time. If they can keep this up, they could very well make a run at another playoff appearance.

5) They still have something to prove

After making it to two consecutive ALCS appearances, there’s no doubt that the Blue Jays are a talented team. However, they still have something to prove – that they can win when it matters most. This could be their chance to show everyone that they’re not just a fluke team and that they’re here to stay

#  One Step Closer: Toronto Blue Jays Winning Streak Continues

The Toronto Blue Jays are on a roll, and there’s no stopping them now.

With their latest win against the Oakland Athletics, the Blue Jays extended their winning streak to six games and continue to inch closer to first place in the American League East.

Marcus Stroman was once again stellar on the mound, pitching seven innings of one-run ball and striking out eight batters.

Meanwhile, at the plate, Justin Smoak led the way with two homers and four RBIs. Kendrys Morales also had a big game, hitting a three-run homer in the second inning.

The Blue Jays will look to keep things going when they take on the Seattle Mariners this weekend.
