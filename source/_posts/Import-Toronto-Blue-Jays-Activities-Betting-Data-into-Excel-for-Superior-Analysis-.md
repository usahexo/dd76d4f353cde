# Import Toronto Blue Jays Activities Betting Data into Excel for Superior Analysis 

The Toronto Blue Jays are a professional baseball team based in Toronto, Ontario. The Blue Jays compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. As of 2019, the Blue Jays have won two World Series championships (1992, 1993).

Toronto Blue Jays Activities Betting Data can provide great insight for future betting on the team. Let’s take a look at how to import this data into Excel for superior analysis.

We will be importing data from:

1. https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/TOR/2019-schedule-results.shtml

2. https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/dal/2019-schedule-results.htm

The first step is to open up both of these web pages in separate tabs in your web browser. Once you have done that, we can start copying and pasting data into Excel.

For the Toronto Blue Jays, we will be copying and pasting data from: 
Date, Opponent, Venue, Score
into Excel columns: A, B, C, D, E and F respectively. For the Dallas Cowboys, we will be copying and pasting data from: 
Date, Opponent, Venue, Score into columns: G, H, I, J, K and L respectively.



 

 

 

Now that our data is in Excel spreadsheet format, let’s start doing some analysis! First let’s take a look at the Toronto Blue Jays’ overall win percentage throughout the 2019 season. We can do this by using the =VLOOKUP() function in Excel. The VLOOKUP() function searches for a value in one column of a table (the leftmost column), and then returns the corresponding value from another column in the table. In our case, we want to find the overall win percentage for the Toronto Blue Jays throughout the 2019 season by using Date as our lookup value. So our formula would looks like this:=VLOOKUP(D4,'TORDATA'!A:F,,2)
Where D4 is the date we are searching for (the first date of our dataset), 'TORDATA'!A:F is our table range (the entire dataset), 2 tells Excel to return only the second column result (meaning win percentage). When you copy this formula down Column J, you will get a list of win percentages for each game played by the Toronto Blue Jays in 2019 so far!

# Use Microsoft Excel to Import Blue Jays Betting Data and Crush the Competition 

Are you a fan of the Blue Jays? If so, you may be wondering how you can use betting data to help you win money.

If you're not familiar with Excel, it's a program that allows you to create and edit spreadsheets. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use Excel to import betting data for the Blue Jays.

First, we'll need to download a CSV file that contains the betting data. You can find this file on the website of Pinnacle Sports (https://www.pinnaclesports.com/en/betting-market/baseball/mlb/canada).

Once you've downloaded the file, open up Excel and create a new spreadsheet. Then, click on "File" and select "Open."

Under "Files of type," select "CSV Files." Then, navigate to the location where you saved the CSV file and open it.

The data in the CSV file will be automatically imported into Excel. Now, we'll need to make some adjustments to the formatting.

In the first column (Column A), remove the header row by selecting it and pressing Delete on your keyboard. Then, in Column B, add a column header titled "Odds." In Column C, add a column header titled "Amount."

Next, we'll adjust the formatting of the Odds column. Select all of the cells in this column and click on "(Number) Custom." In the "Category" field, select "Percentage." In the "Decimals" field, enter 2. Click OK.

Now, we'll adjust the formatting of the Amount column. Select all of the cells in this column and click on "(Currency)" under Number Format. Enter "$10" in the "Symbol" field and select your currency under "Local Currency." Click OK.

Your spreadsheet should now look something like this:



         Blue Jays Betting Data 

 import oddsAmount 

 |Date|Odds|Amount| 
-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|---------------| 
2017-06-02|1.909|$10|2017-06-02 07:00:00 PM EST| 
2017-06-02|1.909|$10|2017-06-02 07:05:00 PM EST|

Now that our spreadsheet is formatted correctly, we can start analyzing the data!

The first thing we'll do is take a look at how often the Blue Jays have been winning games at various odds levels. To do this, we'll use conditional formatting to color code each cell in Column C based on whether or not its value is negative (meaning that they lost that game). For example, here's what it will look like when they've been losing more than they've been winning:



    Losing More Than Winning |Odds|Amount|Color Code |Description | -----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|| | -$,10 | 1.909 | Red | Lost $10 or more | | -$,10 | 1.909 | Red | Lost $10 or more |

As you can see, they've been losing more than they've been winning when playing at odds of 1.909 or higher! This information could be useful if you're looking to bet against them in future matchups.

# Importing Toronto Blue Jays Activities Betting Data into Microsoft Excel

Toronto Blue Jays are a Canadian baseball team formed in 1977. They are a member of the Eastern Division of Major League Baseball's American League. The club plays its home games at the Rogers Centre, formerly known as SkyDome.

Blue Jays betting data can be imported into Microsoft Excel for analysis. After opening Microsoft Excel, select "Data" from the toolbar and then "From Text." This will open up a new window where the text document with the data can be selected.

The first row in the text document should contain the column headers, which in this case are "Date," "Spread," "Money Line," "Total Runs," "Over," and "Under." These column headers will be transferred into Excel and become the column labels in the spreadsheet. The date and spread columns will be dates and numbers, while the money line, total runs, over, and under columns will be text strings.

After selecting the text document, click "Open" and then "OK." The data will be imported into Excel and appear as a table. It is now possible to analyze and compare Toronto Blue Jays betting data for different dates or against other teams.
