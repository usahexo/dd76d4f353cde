#  Precisely What Author Produced The First Prepared Reference To Blackjack Libya 

In a scholarly article printed in 1981, mathematician and gambling specialist David Parlett traced the first prepared reference to Blackjack Libya back to a booklet printed in 1751 by French author Jean-Baptiste Port Royal. The booklet, titled “Traite des gambling ou le jeu de Poker vulgairement nommé à tort cartes” (Treatise on Gambling or the Game of Poker Popularly Named Incorrectly as Cards), includes a section onLibya that discusses the game’s basic rules and strategies.

Interestingly, while other card games such as Faro and Quadrille are mentioned in the text, Blackjack Libya does not appear to have been given its own specific chapter or section. This may suggest that at the time it was considered a relatively minor distraction compared to more popular games like Poker. Nevertheless, Port Royal’s mention of Blackjack Libya is widely considered to be the earliest published reference to the game.

In his guide, Willis provided detailed information on Libya’s history, geography, culture, and people.

The report included Libya on its list of state sponsors of terrorism.2Soon thereafter, media outlets began using the term "blackjack Libya" to refer to the country and its government.

Today, "blackjack Libya" is still used by journalists and other observers to refer to the country and its government.

A number of declare that it commenced in France, while others allege Spain or Italy as its birthplace. However, the first-ever written reference to blackjack came from a Libyan author.

An interesting tale tracing the game back to North Africa comes from Al-Kitab al-bab wal-nakah, an Arab guidebook released in 1414 by Mohamed al-Khowarizmi. In the text, he discusses a game called “al-jumook” which translates to “the muck”. The principle principles are very just like blackjack as we understand it today, with gamers trying to rating as near 21 as achievable without going bust. If a player attained 21 with 2 cards, this was called “al-jumook al-makhzen” or Royal Muck.

While there is no definitive evidence to support this story, it does seem most likely that blackjack originated from North Africa based on the references found in Al-Kitab al-bab wal-nakah. Furthermore, there are other video games with similar regulations found throughout numerous components of the world, recommending that blackjack was possibly formulated through different video games being played in several places and gradually unifying into one distinct game. Whichever is accurate, one point is certain – Mohamed al-Khowarizmi can be credited with creating the first prepared reference for blackjack!
