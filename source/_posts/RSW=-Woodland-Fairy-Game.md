#  RSW= Woodland Fairy Game

In the deepest part of a dark forest, there is a glen that is home to the most enchanting creatures you will ever see. These are the woodland fairies.

The woodland fairies are mischievous and playful, but also very kind and gentle. They love to frolic in the glen and play games. One of their favorite games is RSW or Red Shoes Waltz.

To play RSW, you will need some red shoes and a lot of imagination. The first player puts on the red shoes and starts dancing around the glen. The other players join in, following the lead of the first player. As they dance, they all chant:

"Red shoes, red shoes, who can wear them best? Let's find out by doing a little dance."

As they dance around, they notice that their feet are getting tired. They also start to feel a bit dizzy. Eventually, they all stop dancing and sit down in a circle to take off their red shoes.

The player who has been wearing the red shoes longest is the winner!

#  Who won the last RSW Woodland Fairy Game?

This is a question that is asked frequently on many forums and websites across the internet, but there is no definitive answer. The game, which is also known as the Royal Selangor Woodland Fairy Game, is a race that pits two teams of fairies against each other in a race through the forest. The game has been played for centuries, and many believe that the outcome of the game can foretell the fate of the kingdom.

The race begins at the edge of the forest, and the objective is to reach the castle gates first. The course winds through the trees and over streams, and it can be difficult to navigate. Both teams have their own fairy queen, and they use their magic to help them navigate and find shortcuts.

The last Royal Selangor Woodland Fairy Game was played in 2010, and there is no record of who won. However, some believe that it was the fairies from Team White who emerged victorious.
