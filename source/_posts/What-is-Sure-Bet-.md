#  What is Sure Bet? 

A sure bet, sometimes called an sure thing, is a wager in which the expected value is positive. In other words, the player has a mathematically calculable edge over the house.

A player making a sure bet is said to be "playing with the house's money".

There are two types of sure bets:

The most common type of sure bet is where the gambler bets against independent events (e.g. tossing a coin) and can guarantee themselves a profit no matter what the outcome. For example, if someone offered even money on whether a coin would come up heads or tails, that would be an example of a sure bet. This is because whichever side the coin falls on, you will make a profit as long as you bet £1 on it – you will win £2 if it lands on tails, and lose £1 if it lands on heads, meaning you make £1 in total whatever happens. 

Another type of sure bet exists when one places multiple bets at once (also known as an accumulator), where all selections must win for the gambler to take home a profit. For example, consider betting on four football matches: Match 1: Home Win @ 2.0 Match 2: Away Win @ 3.0 Match 3: Draw @ 2.5 
Match 4: Away Win @ 6.0  If all four matches resulted in the predicted outcomes, then your overall return on investment (ROI) would be calculated as follows: ((2 x 1) + (3 x 1) + (2 x 1) + (6 x 1)) - ((1 x 2) + (1 x 3) + (1 x 2) + (1 x 6)) = 13 - 16 = -3 So while three out of four results in profit, one result results in a loss – however this loss is offset by the three winning predictions, meaning your overall ROI is positive.

It's important to note that there are many online tools which can help gamblers calculate their expected values when placing accumulator bets; without such tools it can be difficult to ensure one's bets are properly hedged against losses.
